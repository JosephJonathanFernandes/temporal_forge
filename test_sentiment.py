print("=" * 80)
print("""
The sentiment classifier is KEYWORD-BASED and uses simple counting:
- It's fast and doesn't require ML models
- Works well for clear outcomes ("worked well" vs "didn't help")
- Can be fooled by complex sentences with mixed sentiments
- Special phrases handle common medical documentation patterns

To improve accuracy:
1. Add more keywords to POSITIVE_KEYWORDS/NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS
2. Add more special phrases for medical context
3. Consider upgrading to VADER (sentiment analysis library) for better accuracy
4. Or use transformer models (BERT) for state-of-the-art results
