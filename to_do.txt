## 🧭 **Top Innovative Features (Feasible in 6 Hours)**

| ⏱ Priority | Feature                                              | Why It’s Innovative                                                                                                       | Implementation Hint                                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Core 1   | **Auto Knowledge Extraction (NER + Sentiment)**      | Automatically converts messy healer notes into structured “wisdom” — not a search bar but intelligent text understanding. | Use spaCy for entity recognition and VADER for sentiment.     |
| ✅ Core 2   | **"Cures that Work" vs "Cures that Fail" Dashboard** | Visually divides positive vs negative mentions, just like discovering “successful treatments.”                            | Use Chart.js bar chart comparing counts.                      |
| ✅ Core 3   | **AI-Generated Summary of Wisdom**                   | Summarization makes your project feel like an intelligent assistant, not just analytics.                                  | Use HuggingFace’s `bart-large-cnn` or `t5-small`.             |
| ⚡ Core 4   | **Interactive Keyword Map / Word Cloud**             | Shows what “themes” emerge from the scrolls, bringing life to the data.                                                   | Use `wordcloud` or Plotly.                                    |
| ⚙️ Core 5  | **Healer–Cure–Outcome Table (Auto-Structured)**      | Converts text into a mini-knowledge base — this is “automatic structuring of unstructured text,” the core challenge!      | Parse NER output + sentiment into a Pandas table and show it. |

## 🎨 **Creative Features (Adds “Wow” Factor in Judging)**

| ⏱ Priority | Feature                          | Why It Stands Out                                                                                                    | Implementation Hint                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌿 C1      | **Healer’s Network Graph**       | Visual network linking healers → cures → outcomes (shows patterns at a glance).                                      | Use `networkx` + `pyvis` for an interactive graph. |
| 💬 C2      | **AI Insight Generator**         | Generate a one-liner like “Garlic appears most effective for infections.” (auto-detected trend)                      | Use sentiment stats and string templates.          |
| 🔍 C3      | **Smart Filter & Search**        | Allow filtering “herbs that work” / “diseases with most complaints.”                                                 | Use JS filtering or Pandas queries.                |
| 🧬 C4      | **Historical Scroll Comparison** | Compare two sets of notes (before/after) to see if new cures work better.                                            | Use two text boxes, compute differential summary.  |
| 🕯️ C5     | **Medieval-Themed UI**           | Give it a parchment scroll aesthetic, candle icons, and medieval font. Visual storytelling scores creativity points! | Bootstrap + CSS background with parchment tone.    |

| 🧠 B1      | **Auto Tagging of Themes**               | E.g., tags like *“Herbal Remedies”*, *“Prayer-Based Cures”*, *“Infection-Related”* auto-assigned by NLP clustering. | Use KMeans or topic modeling (LDA).                        |
| 🧾 B2      | **Export as “Wisdom Scroll” PDF/CSV**    | Judges love export features for reporting.                                                                          | Use `pandas.to_csv()` or `reportlab`.                      |
| 🔄 B3      | **Chatbot Interface (“Ask the Healer”)** | Ask: “Which cures work for fever?” → chatbot retrieves patterns.                                                    | Use Flask route with similarity search or small RAG model. |
| 🌐 B4      | **Multilingual Scrolls (Optional)**      | Handle texts in multiple languages with translation API.                                                            | Use `deep-translator`.                                     |
| 📊 B5      | **Time-based Trend Graph**               | Show how certain cures gained/lost effectiveness over time (if timestamps available).                               | Use Plotly line chart.                                     |
